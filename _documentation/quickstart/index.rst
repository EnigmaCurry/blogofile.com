Quickstart Guide
################

This guide will help you get a copy of Blogofile installed on your
computer and help you to create a simple blog.

To start out, you can perform all of these steps on your desktop
computer. You won't need to run Blogofile on a server (although you
can if you want.) Blogofile builds static websites, so we'll build a
website locally on your desktop and then test it in your webbrowser
using Blogofile's embedded webserver. You can take the static website
files that Blogofile generates and upload them to a webhost later on.
