The development version of blogofile now includes the following features:

* Syntax highlighting - thanks to [pygments](http://www.pygments.org)
* Markdown support - thanks to [markdown in python](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/)

Check out [some examples here](/demo/sample_posts.html)
