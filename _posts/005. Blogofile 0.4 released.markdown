title: Blogofile 0.4 released

I've just released Blogofile 0.4. 

Nothing terribly major, but it does represent a maturing product:

 * Less buggy syntax highlighting now with a home-grown &lt;pre&gt; tag parser
 * [EnigmaCurry.com](http://www.enigmacurry.com), my personal blog, is now powered by Blogofile. This shows that real blogs can and do run Blogofile.
